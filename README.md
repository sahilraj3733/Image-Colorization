 # Image Colorization Using Conditional GAN (cGAN)
 
 This project uses a Conditional GAN (cGAN) model to automatically colorize grayscale images. The generator is based on the U-Net architecture, while the discriminator follows the PatchGAN structure. The model learns to predict realistic color channels (a, b) from grayscale (L) images in the Lab color space, trained on the CelebA dataset.
